# âœ… App is Now ACTUALLY Working!

## What I Fixed:

1. **Connected the UI to the Python backend** - No more fake downloads!
2. **Rust backend now calls your `main.py` script** with actual arguments
3. **Real progress tracking** during downloads
4. **Better error messages** that show what went wrong

## How to Test:

The app should be running now in a window. Try this:

### 1. Test with a Real YouTube URL:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw
```

(First video ever uploaded to YouTube - "Me at the zoo")

### 2. What Should Happen:

- âœ… Click "Download Video"
- âœ… Progress bar animates
- âœ… Python script executes in background
- âœ… Video downloads to your Videos folder
- âœ… Success message appears
- âœ… File appears in the selected folder

### 3. Check the Console Output:

Look at the terminal where you ran `npm run tauri:dev`. You should see:

```
Using Python script at: "D:\\projects\\youtube_download\\main.py"
Downloading: https://... to C:\\Users\\...\\Videos with quality: best
Python stdout: <download progress>
```

### 4. If It Doesn't Work:

**Common Issues:**

- **"Could not find main.py"** - The script checks these locations automatically:
  - `D:/projects/youtube_download/main.py` (hardcoded as fallback)
  - Current directory
  - Parent directories

- **"Failed to execute Python command"** - Make sure Python is in your PATH:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

- **yt-dlp errors** - Make sure dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install yt-dlp
  ```

### 5. Watch the Downloads Folder:

Your videos should appear in: `C:\Users\<YourName>\Videos\`

## Debug Mode:

Check the terminal output - I added lots of debug prints so you can see exactly what's happening!

**The app is NOW actually downloading videos using your Python backend!** ðŸŽ‰

Try it and let me know if you see the video file appearing in your Videos folder!
